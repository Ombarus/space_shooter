# Space Shooter Proto


## Introduction

**Space Shooter Proto** is a prototype multiplayer free-to-play Player vs Player Game aiming to re-create the fun of games like Liero, Quake and Unreal in Space. The idea would be to incorporate a metagame similar to Clash Royale or Fortnite style F2P experience.

Long term goal:
* Upgradable Ships and weapons
* Variety of maps with hasards and pickups
* Authoritative server
* Matchmaking
* 2v2, 3v3, 4v4+ pvp matches
